Exercise 1 - shell
Took me several hours to make them correct. Finally realize it's not easy to fully understand how process & pipe works
1. When creating a new file in a child process, it's better to explicitly specify the mode for the file
2. It's important to close the file descriptor of write in pipe when the read starts
3. Need to specify the full path of exec file such as /bin/ls and /usr/bin/wc. The exercise shell does not give error msg when a cmd does not exist.
