== Lecture 2 ==
1. Assembly convention - Intel Syntax vs AT&T Syntax
2. Difference among Memory-mapped I/O, Port-mapped I/O and Dedicated I/O

== Lecture 6 ==
1. xchg operation
An example of spin lock
spin_lock:
mov eax, 1
xchg eax, [lock_var]	// atomically swap eax register with lock variable
test eax, eax			// if it's previosly unlocked, zero flag will set
jnz spin_lock			// if it's previously locked, go to the very beginning
ret

spin_unlock:
move eax, 0
xchg eax, [lock_var]	// atomically swap and set 0 to lock variable
ret

2. pushcli and popcli
cli - instruction used to disable interrupts and does not disable on other processors
sti - instruction used to enable interrupts by setting the IF flag
