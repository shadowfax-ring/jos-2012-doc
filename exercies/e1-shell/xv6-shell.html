<h1>In-class assignment: shell</h1>

<p>This assignment will make you more familiar with the Unix system call interface
and the shell by implementing several features in a small shell.  You can
do this assignment on any operating system that supports the Unix API
(a Linux Athena machine, your laptop with Linux or MacOS, etc.).  At the
end of class submit your shell to the
<a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/submit/">submission web site</a>.

<p>Download the <a href="sh.c">skeleton</a> of the xv6 shell, and look it
over. The skeleton shell contains two main parts: parsing shell commands and
implementing them. The parser recognizes only simple shell commands such as the
following:

<pre>
ls > y
cat < y | sort | uniq | wc > y1
cat y1
rm y1
ls |  sort | uniq | wc
rm y
</pre>
Cut and paste these commands into a file <tt>t.sh</tt>

You can compile the skeleton shell as follows:
<pre>
$ gcc sh.c
</pre>
which produce an <tt>a.out</tt> file, which you can run:
<pre>
$ ./a.out < t.sh
</pre>
This execution will panic because you have not implemented several features. In
the rest of this assignment you will implement those features.

<h2>Executing simple commands</h2>

<p>Implement simple commands, such as:
<pre>
$ ls
</pre>
The parser already builds an <tt>execcmd</tt> for you, so the only code you have
to write is for the ' ' case in <tt>runcmd</tt>.  To test that you can run "ls".
You might find it useful to look at the manual page for exec; type "man 3 exec".

<h2>I/O redirection</h2>

<p>Implement I/O redirection commands so that you can run:
<pre>
echo "6.828 is cool" > x.txt
cat < x.txt
</pre>

The parser already recognizes ">" and "<", and builds a <tt>redircmd</tt> for
you, so your job is just filling out the missing code in <tt>runcmd</tt> for
those symbols.  Make sure your implementation runs correctly with the above test
input.  You might find the man pages for open and close useful.

<h2>Implement pipes</h2>

<p>Implement pipes so that you can run command pipelines such as:
<pre>
$ ls | sort | uniq | wc
</pre>
The parser already recognizes "|", and builds a <tt>pipecmd</tt> for you, so the
only code you must write is for the '|' case in <tt>runcmd</tt>.  Test that you
can run the above pipeline.  You might find the man pages for pipe, fork, close, and
dup useful.

<p>Now you should be able the following command correctly:
<pre>
$ a.out < t.sh
</pre>

<p>Don't forget to submit your solution to the <a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/submit/">submission web site</a>, with or without
challenge solutions.

<h2>Challenge exercises</h2>

<p>You can add any feature of your choice to your shell.  But, you may want consider
the following as a start:
<ul>
<li> Implement lists of commands, separated by ";"
<li> Implement sub shells by implementing "(" and ")"
<li> Implement running commands in the background by supporting "&" and "wait"
</ul>
All of these require making changing to the parser and the <tt>runcmd</tt>
function.
